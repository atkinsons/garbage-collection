1. For the Reassign and Nullify classes I am overriding the finalize method to display the name of the object before it is being garbage collected.

I think my expected print line output should be:

variable1 successfully garbage collected
nullify1 successfully garbage collected

My actual out put is:

variable1 successfully garbage collected
null successfully garbage collected
nullify1 successfully garbage collected
variable2 successfully garbage collected
null successfully garbage collected

How are these other outputs being generated?
